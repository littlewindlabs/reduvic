# Reduvic
**Browser extension to help researchers manage exposure to upsetting images and videos**

## Summary
The name "Reduvic" comes from its goal - "REDUce VICarious trauma". 

Reduvic is at an early stage of development. Currently, it makes images and videos grayscale, which research suggests reduces the impact of upsetting content.
